# Risk-Monitoring-Dashboard-PowerB
This project focuses on building an interactive Risk Monitoring Dashboard using Power BI to analyze financial transactions and identify high-risk activities.

The dashboard highlights key risk indicators such as transaction risk rate, total amount at risk, and high-risk incidents. It also analyzes risk patterns across transaction types, payment methods, users, and system performance metrics

By combining DAX measures and interactive slicers, the dashboard enables dynamic exploration of risk trends, supports fraud detection, and helps decision-makers monitor and mitigate potential financial and operational risks.
